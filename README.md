## Quiescence score package

We provide a package to calculate the quiescence score as described in the publication here: ![QuieScore package](https://github.com/dkornai/QuieScore/tree/master)

## System Requirements
Operating system(s): Unix (linux, mac)

Programming Language: R

## Data
The majority of the data used in this work can be found in the folder /Data.

## How to run a script (DEMO)

1) Check that all the depencies are installed
2) Open RStudio or an R-shell
3) Set the working directory to the path with the script of interest as follows

For example if the user wants to run the pan-cancer elastic net regression model (PanCancer_ElasticNetRegression.R) then these are the steps to follow:

```r
# Move to the respective directory 
setwd("CancerCellQuiescence/PanCancer_ElasticNetRegression/ElasticNetRegressionModel/Code/")

# run the script
source("PanCancer_ElasticNetRegression.R")
```
